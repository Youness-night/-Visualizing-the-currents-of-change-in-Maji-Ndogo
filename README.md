## Project Overview
This project was a comprehensive exploration of data analytics and visualization techniques to address the water crisis in Maji Ndogo (An imaginary African country). Utilizing Power BI, we developed interactive dashboards, performed data cleaning, and applied DAX for data aggregation, thereby enhancing our skills in data visualization and analysis. This experience equipped us with the ability to communicate complex data insights effectively to stakeholders.

## Project Structure
The project was divided into four parts, each focusing on different aspects of data visualization and analysis:

### Part 1 – Visualising Maji Ndogo’s Past
In this part, we introduced updated data on the gender composition at shared water taps and crime-related data. We created basic visuals, gradually diving into crime-related data and gender parity data related to water, illustrating the correlation between women queuing and being victims of crime. The primary goal was to visualize the national survey data results to report it in the future.

### Part 2 – Moulding Data into Visual Stories in Maji Ndogo
In the second part, we focused on data models. We imported tables separately, cleaned data, and set up a working relational data model in Power BI. We also recreated our visuals with the new data model and saw how the new model affected our visuals. Our goal was to refine the visuals, customizing text, colors, and fonts to make the visuals clear and simple.

### Part 3 – Communicating Our Findings in Maji Ndogo
In the third part, we finalized our national survey report. We used DAX to create measures and columns to enrich our data and ensure accurate and useful data representation on the dashboard. We put together all we had learned in the module to create the survey report.

### Part 4 – Transparency in Tracking Maji Ndogo's Water Funds
In the final part, we used all the skills acquired in the course to build a public dashboard. Our mission was to communicate with transparency: Where did the money go? We tracked the total budget against project completion, monitored teams' performance, and compared budgeted versus actual costs to flag potential corruption, promoting transparency and accountability in addressing Maji Ndogo’s water crisis.

## Key Points
- **Overall Water Access Status:** Understanding the current state of water access in Maji Ndogo.
- **Number of People Affected by Water Access Challenges:** Identifying the extent of the impact on the community.
- **Financial Data Needed for Upgrades:** Analyzing the financial requirements to address the water crisis.
- **Gender Composition at Shared Water Taps:** Examining the gender dynamics at communal water points.
- **Crime-Related Data:** Investigating the correlation between water access challenges and crime rates.
- **Data Analysis at National, Provincial, and Rural/Urban Levels:** Providing a comprehensive view to inform decision-making at various administrative levels.
